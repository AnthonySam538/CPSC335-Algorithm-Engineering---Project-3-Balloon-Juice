CPSC 335-03: Algorithm Engineering
Project #3: Balloon Juice
Team Anthony: Anthony Sam

Introduction:
This project features a bot going on a round trip from its starting node to its destination and then back again. As it makes its way around, an adjacency list is shown to represent the graph, and an adjacency matrix is shown to display the length of the shortest path between any pair of nodes. The Warshall-Floyd algorithm is used for this exact purpose.

Contents:
balloon juice.js - Contains the bulk of the programming (Requires the stuffin p5.js to work)
main.html - Brings all of the other files together into an html page.
p5.js - Contains a bunch of classes and functions
README.txt - Detailed information about the project (You're reading this file right now)
style.css - Supplemental visual details used by main.html
