This is the html file. It defines how the html page looks and how it 
functions. We can see that this .html file is importing over multiple 
other files to help define the html page. Namely, style.css, p5.js, and
sort race.js. -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Bring over the .css file -->
    <script src="p5.js"></script> <!-- Bring over the p5.js file --> <!-- Doing this allows the ant.js file to use the stuff in p5.js (More info about p5.js: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki) -->
