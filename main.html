This is the html file. It defines how the html page looks and how it 
functions. We can see that this .html file is importing over multiple 
other files to help define the html page. Namely, style.css, p5.js, and
balloon juice.js. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> <!-- This is the head of the HTML page -->
    <title>The search for balloon juice</title> <!-- Title of the browser tab -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Bring over the .css file -->
    <script src="p5.js"></script> <!-- Import p5.js file to allow balloon juice.js.js file to use the stuff in p5.js (More info about p5.js: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki) -->
    <script src="balloon juice.js"></script> <!-- Use the balloon juice.js file -->
  </head>
